Group Work Assignment 1 - A1-Group 28
=====================================

WORK DIVISION
    We've decided to divide the work as follows: all three members have used a version control system,
    namely, Git, to manage, track the changes and distribute the work amongst the other members.
    More specifically, each member has been assigned a specific git branch to work on, named after their
    respective names. The `main` branch is the one that contains the final version of the code, and the
    other branches are used to develop the code. The `debug` branch has been used to test the code, before
    being merged into the `main` branch via CodeGrade.

    Linked repository:
        - https://github.com/michalspano/A1-G28

    Note: for the sake of discretion, the repository is private and can only be accessed by the members;
        however, the access may be granted upon request.

SPECIFIC TASK DIVISION
    The specific tasks that each member has been assigned are the following:
        - Ionel: 
            own implementations of the task 1 through 5; work on the Menu part of the program; work on the custom
            Scanner class (`IOScanner.java`) and refactoring the source code into subsequent subroutines.

        - Joel: 
            own implementations of the task 1 through 5; implementation of generalized functionalities for the 
            initial tasks, these are indicated in the `Menu.java` file inside block comments; work on the custom
            Scanner class (`IOScanner.java`) and refactoring the source code into subsequent subroutines.

        - Michal: 
            own implementations of the task 1 through 5; communication platform for the group; VSC (via Git) 
            management; work on the custom Scanner class (`IOScanner.java`) and refactoring the source code into 
            subsequent subroutines; analysis of the source code via comments.

    *Most of the tasks were done in parallel, that is, during a meeting or via a communication platform, such as
    for the tasks 7 and 8, where the members have discussed the implementation of the custom Scanner class and
    the refactoring of the source code into subsequent subroutines. Similarly, after each member has implemented
    their own versions of 1 through 5, the members have discussed possible pros and cons of each implementation
    and have decided on the final version of the code, which is a combined version of all three members' contributions.
    Lastly, the members have discussed and proposed generalized solutions for some of the tasks which are indicated 
    in the `Menu.java` file inside block comments.
